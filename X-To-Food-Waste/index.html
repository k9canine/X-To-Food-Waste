          “Food waste” is a component of food loss and occurs when an edible item goes unconsumed. This includes the half-eaten meal left on the plate at a restaurant, food scraps from preparing a meal at home and the sour milk a family pours down the drain.

        <h1 class = "problem-header">The Problem:</h1>
        <div class = "problem-text">
          <p><strong>A third of food waste generated by consumers is entirely avoidable and is edible!</strong> However, this food is instead sent directly to landfills where it gradually breaks down to form methane, a greenhouse gas that’s up to 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. According to a report from the UK based organization WRAP, <em>if food were removed from UK landfills, the greenhouse gas abatement would be <strong>equivalent to removing one-fifth of all the cars in the UK from the road!</strong></em>
          </p>
          <p>Consumer food waste also has <u>serious implications for energy usage</u>. A study by the consulting group McKinsey found that, on average, household food losses are responsible for <strong>eight times</strong> the energy waste of farm-level food losses due to the energy used along the food supply chain and in preparation. </p>
          <p>Given all the resources demanded for food production, it is worth our while to make sure that the food we produce is not wasted. <em>If even just one-fourth of the food currently lost or wasted globally could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people in the world.</em>
          </p>
          <p class = "last-para">Therefore, as homes remain a large source of food waste, more needs to be done to help educate the public and provide people with resources to help them implement food saving practices at home.

          <h1 class = "consequences-text">Food Spoilage</h1>
          <p class = "consequences-text">About two-thirds of food waste at home is due to food not being used before it goes bad. Food spoilage at home occurs due to improper storage, lack of visibility in refrigerators, partially used ingredients and misjudged food needs. A number of methods of prevention can be used that can either totally prevent, delay, or otherwise reduce food spoilage. A food rotation system uses the first in first out method (FIFO), which ensures that the first item purchased is the first item consumed.

        <div class = "consequences-box green">
          <h1 class = "consequences-text">Over-Preparing </h1>
          <p class = "consequences-text">The remaining third of household food waste is the result of people cooking or serving too much food. Cooking portions have increased over time, and large meals often include more food than we can finish. The Cornell Food and Brand lab found that since 2006, serving sizes in the classic cookbook The Joy of Cooking have increased by 36 percent. In addition, people often forget to eat leftovers, and end up throwing them away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "consequences-box light-green">
          <h1 class = "consequences-text">Overbuying/Poor Planning</h1>
          <p class = "consequences-text">Sales on unusual products and promotions that encourage impulse and bulk food purchases at retail stores often lead consumers to purchase items that do not fit into their regular meal plans and, therefore, spoil before they can be used. Additionally, without meal plans and shopping lists, consumers often make inaccurate estimates of what and how many ingredients they will use during the week. Unplanned restaurant meals or food delivery can also lead to food at home going bad before it can be used.</p>
