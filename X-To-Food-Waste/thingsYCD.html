        <p class="hiddentext">.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p1"><strong>üõí Food Planning</strong><br>
        
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Preplan what you want to buy before going to the grocery store. Check your kitchen to make sure that you are not re-buying something you already have.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Stick to your plan and avoid buying more food than you need! This is extremely important because most people buy more than they need and perhaps you do it as well without realizing.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Try making small grocery trips frequently rather than a bulk shopping trip once in a while to make sure you do not over-buy.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Don't be picky. Buy items that may look ugly/different from other items on the outside but still taste as good from the inside.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-space"></p>
        
        <h2 class="thingsYCD-left-h2">üçΩÔ∏è Eating Out</h2>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Ask for smaller portions to prevent plate waste.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ If you have leftovers, ask for takeaway box to take your leftovers home so that you can finish your leftovers later.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-space"></p>

        <h2 class="thingsYCD-left-h2">ü•ù Storage</h2>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Check your fridge temperature (ideally at 40¬∞ F or below, for freezer it should be 0¬∞ F) to ensure your food is well-preserved in the fridge.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ If you don't know how to store certain types of food, search up the information online or ask others for help.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Make use of your freezer! It often allows most food to be stored longer.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Check your fridge often to see what food you have and what food you should use soon before it turns bad. Place the food you need to use in aside from other food so you can notice them easier!</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ If you think the food you have in storage is much more than what you can eat/need, donate your extra supply to a local food pantry or food drive. You can always refer to the list we made on your left side.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Understand your food's label dates. "Use by" refers to the date by which the food is safe to eat, while "Best before" indicates that your food tastes the best before that date and it is still safe to consume after the date passes.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-space"></p>

        <h2 class="thingsYCD-left-h2">üçî Leftovers</h2>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Save leftovers!</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Try putting your leftovers in clear containers so you remember to use them.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ You may want to designate certain days to use up your leftovers. This will encourage you to actually finish them up and not just storing just to throw them away eventually.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ Compost if possible. It is a great way to avoid wasting leftovers while giving back to plants.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-space"></p>

        <h2 class="thingsYCD-left-h2">üëç Volunteer</h2>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ There are many food rescue organizations around the world. Find one near where you live and apply as a volunteer.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-left-p">‚Ä¢ You yourself can start your own project to help food waste! As long as you have passion, this is totally do-able. You can start with small projects like creating a blog or website to raise awareness about food waste. Bigger projects may include starting a food drive or collecting extra food from supermarket/restaurants to turn into meals for people in need.</p>
