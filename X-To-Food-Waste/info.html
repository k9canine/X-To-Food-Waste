    <h2 class="info-html-left-h2">The causes of food waste </h2>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• According from <a href="https://foodprint.org/">footprint.org</a>: Approximately 4 to 10 percent of food purchased by restaurants is wasted before reaching the consumer. According to the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab, on average, diners leave 17 percent of their meals uneaten and 55 percent of edible leftovers are left at the restaurant.</p>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• According from <a href="https://foodprint.org/">footprint.org</a>, of the estimated 125 to 160 billion pounds of food that goes to waste every year, much of it is perfectly edible and nutritious.</p>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• In terms of total mass, fresh fruits and vegetables account for the largest losses at the consumer level (19 percent of fruits and 22 percent of vegetables), followed by dairy (20 percent), meat (21 percent) and seafood (31 percent).</p>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• Here the cause of food being wasted: bad weather, processing problems, overproduction and unstable markets cause food loss long before it arrives in a grocery store, while overbuying, poor planning and confusion over labels and safety contribute to food waste at stores and in homes.</p>

        <h2 class="info-html-left-h2">The environmental impact of food waste</h2>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• According from <a href="https://foodprint.org/">footprint.org</a>: Only five percent of food is composted in the US and as a result, uneaten food is the single largest component of municipal solid waste.</p>
         <p class="info-html-left-p">• In landfills, food gradually breaks down to form methane, a greenhouse gas that’s up to 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p class="info-html-left-p">• In addition, food waste is responsible for more than 25 percent of all the freshwater consumption in the US each year, and is among the leading causes of fresh water pollution.</p>
        <p class="thingsYCD-space"></p>
